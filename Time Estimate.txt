Risk Assessment:::

The Figma file is not providing high-quality or appropriately sized images.
This could lead to delays in UI implementation, as you might 
need to spend extra time extracting and optimizing images.
Lack of API Endpoints:

There are no available API endpoints, making it impossible to interact with live data.
